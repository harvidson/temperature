Temperature is a React app that lets leaders take the temperature of their group and track it over time. Aimed at educators and leaders, it combines reflective writing that only the writer will see with aggregate data analytics that show leaders how the group is doing at any point in time. The app lets leaders invite participants to a journal, assign reflections with targeted questions, and see D3 visualizations of sentiment analysis data generated by Google's Natural Language API.
